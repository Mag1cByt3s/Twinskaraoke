import SwiftUI

/// Presents the full-screen player above the whole app, and owns the gesture
/// that dismisses it.
///
/// It is an overlay rather than a `fullScreenCover` because the dismissal has
/// to be finger-tracked, and a modal presentation's transition is not ours to
/// drive. It is a sibling of the app shell rather than a child of any screen
/// because it has to cover the tab bar.
///
/// The gesture is attached with plain `.gesture(_:)`, and that is a deliberate
/// choice rather than an incidental one. SwiftUI resolves a child's gesture
/// before its container's, so the scrubber in `AppleMusicProgressBar`, the
/// volume row, and the lyrics and queue scroll views all keep their own drags,
/// while every other point on the player belongs to this. `simultaneousGesture`
/// would let this run *alongside* the scrubber and drag the player while
/// someone is trying to seek; `highPriorityGesture` would take the scrubber
/// away entirely.
///
/// That single line is what the library this replaces spent its gesture layer
/// trying to achieve. Because it was retrofitting onto view trees it did not
/// own, it had to negotiate: declare a failure requirement against every other
/// recognizer in the content, then graft its own handler onto whichever of
/// those recognizers it could find at open-time. When the graft missed — and
/// against SwiftUI's recognizers it always missed, because the handler
/// string-matched for `UIScrollView` — both paths went dead and the player
/// simply stopped responding to downward drags. We own this view tree, so
/// there is nothing to negotiate with.
