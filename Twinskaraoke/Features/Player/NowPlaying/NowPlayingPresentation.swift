/// scalar comes from: there, it was read back out of a `UIView`'s live frame,
/// which is why the state machine needed six variables to describe three
/// states. Here it is just a stored property, and the views follow it.

/// `isExpanded` is the *committed* state, not the visual one. A dismissal drag
/// in progress leaves it true until the gesture actually commits, so things
/// that key off "the player is open" — the ambient background's breathing
/// (`FullScreenPlayerView`), Shimeji's floor (`ShimejiEngine`) — do not flicker
/// while someone drags halfway down and changes their mind.
