/// Keeps a pushed zoom destination off iOS 26's interactive-dismissal path.
///
/// `.navigationTransition(.zoom)` on a push has an iOS 26 defect: after an
/// *interactive* dismissal the transition keeps running, and UIKit will not
/// begin another navigation until it finishes — so the next tap does nothing for
/// as long as the animation lasts, which scales with how far the finger dragged.
/// Worse, the outgoing screen keeps hit testing for that whole time, so a tap
/// meant for the grid underneath lands on the shrinking detail view instead.
/// Dismissing the same screen with the back button completes immediately.
/// Reported and unanswered since June 2025:
/// https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/789010
///
/// So the interactive path is removed and replaced with an equivalent gesture
/// that goes through `dismiss()` — the back-button path. The zoom still
/// animates; it simply is not finger-driven.
///
/// Note what this buys beyond responsiveness: a push is dismissed by a
/// *horizontal* gesture, so vertical pulls stay free for the destination — which
/// is why PlaylistDetailView can keep its pull-to-reveal search without any
/// staging or arbitration. A modal presentation adds a vertical drag-dismiss
/// instead, which fights that reveal, and also covers the LNPopup mini player.
/// Pushing avoids both. (Horizontal, not edge-limited: see below.)
///
/// **The replacement has to cover the whole screen, not just the edge.** UIKit's
/// content swipe is not edge-limited: measured on iOS 26.5, a right-swipe
/// starting 80pt in dismissed the destination. An earlier version of this put a
/// 20pt gesture strip along the leading edge instead, and suppressing the system
/// recogniser then had a second effect nobody wanted — with nothing claiming a
/// horizontal drag over the content, the row underneath received it as a plain
/// tap and started playing, because a touch that ends inside a button's own
/// bounds is a tap no matter how far it travelled sideways. So the replacement
/// is a real pan on the whole screen: it cancels content touches the moment it
/// begins, and dismisses on release.
///
/// Delete this once Apple fixes the transition, and restore the real
/// interactive dismissal — finger-tracking is the better interaction.
