    ///
    /// `UITabBarController.MinimizeBehavior` has no threshold to tune; the four
    /// public cases are the whole API, and UIKit drives `.onScrollDown` from a
    /// private scroll-away interaction whose reveal distance is long. Measured on
    /// iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5: six separate ~60pt upward drags left the bar
    /// minimized, and only one ~440pt drag brought it back.
    ///
    /// So the reveal is driven from here. A pan recognizer on the tab bar
    /// controller's view finds the scroll view under the touch, and the distance
    /// is then measured on that scroll view's `contentOffset` — how far the
    /// content has travelled back up since its last reversal. Past
    /// `revealDistance` the declared behaviour flips to `.never`, which is what
    /// makes UIKit restore the full-size bar. It flips back to `.onScrollDown`
    /// once the user heads down again or the scroll settles, so the next downward
    /// scroll still minimizes it.
    ///
    /// The distance is deliberately measured on the content and not on the
    /// finger: a quick flick travels barely any distance under the thumb but
    /// coasts a long way, and measuring the finger left those flicks short of the
    /// threshold with the bar still minimized. Deceleration keeps changing
    /// `contentOffset` after the lift, so tracking the content covers the drag
    /// and its momentum with one threshold and no velocity guesswork.
    ///
    /// **The flip is told to UIKit only, never declared to SwiftUI.** That is
    /// the whole reason this works. `mode` used to be `@Observable` and fed
    /// `.tabBarMinimizeBehavior(_:)` as well, and the declared value changing
    /// re-rendered the tab bar: the `tabViewBottomAccessory` took its expanded
    /// frame, rebuilt itself back at the inline one, and corrected only when the
    /// behaviour was handed back — so the mini player sat at the wrong width for
    /// as long as that took, which on device read as a second of the pill being
    /// in the wrong place. Measured with the assignment alone, the accessory
    /// makes exactly one clean move (x=84 w=234 to x=21 w=360, ~54ms) and the
    /// hand-back changes nothing.
    ///
    /// So `.tabBarMinimizeBehavior(.onScrollDown)` stays declared and constant.
    /// If SwiftUI happens to re-apply it during the brief `.never` window the
    /// reveal is simply lost, which is a missed reveal rather than a glitch.
    ///
    /// The flip runs without checking whether the bar is actually minimized,
    /// because nothing public reports that: `UITabBar`'s frame and origin and the
    /// container's bottom safe-area inset are all identical in both states. On an
